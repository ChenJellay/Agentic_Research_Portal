For example, AI-driven tools like Codiga and SonarQube with AI enhancements can detect code smells, security issues, and duplicate code, while also formatting code according to project-specific style guides and identifying naming conventions, indentation, and documentation inconsistencies [ijnrd_2024, ijnr_2024_chunk_0035].\n\nThese tools help maintain coding standards and suggest best practices and industry-standard coding guidelines, thereby enhancing the quality and maintainability of the code. However, the context does not explicitly mention that developers need to actively review, modify, and validate AI-generated code.

The ACM 2025 paper mentions that AI can help in enhancing software testing, development, and testing, and main maintenance, which aligns with the idea of peer code review improving code quality. Similarly, the IJSRA 2024 paper suggests that peer code review helps improve the code, indicating a shared view on the positive impact of peer code review on code quality.\n\n**Disagreement:**\nThe ACM 2025 paper focuses on the broader role of AI in software engineering, including the management, exploration, and evolution of modeling ecosystems, suggesting that AI can significantly transform the developer role by automating and enhancing various aspects of software development. In contrast, the IJSRA 2024 paper emphasizes the challenges and perceptions of peer code review, highlighting that while peer code review is important, it also faces challenges such as overreliance on AI, which can lead to a decrease in developer involvement and expertise.
