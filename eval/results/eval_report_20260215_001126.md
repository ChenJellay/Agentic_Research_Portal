**Answer snippet**: Security concerns raised about AI-generated code include the potential for introducing security flaws, generating insecure or vulnerable code, and exposure to AI-generated malware. Specifically, AI-assisted coding tools can inadvertently introduce security flaws into software due to insecure code su…

## Interpretation

- **Groundedness** measures what fraction of answer sentences are supported by at least one retrieved chunk (word-overlap heuristic, threshold=0.15).
- **Citation Precision** measures what fraction of inline `[source_id, chunk_id]` citations point to chunks that actually support the enclosing sentence.
- Failure cases highlight queries where either metric fell below 0.5, indicating the model may have hallucinated or cited irrelevant chunks.
