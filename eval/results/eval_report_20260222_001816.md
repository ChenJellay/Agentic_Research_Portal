## Representative Failure Cases

### Failure 1: d02

**Query**: How do AI code-generation tools affect developer productivity according to the corpus?

**Groundedness**: 0.4
**Citation Precision**: 0.0

**Ungrounded sentences**:
> Specifically, these tools can lead to shorter development cycles and improved code quality, allowing developers to focus more on higher-level problem-solving and innovation rather than mundane coding tasks.
> [source_id=ijnrd_2024, chunk_id=ijnrd_2024_chunk_0043] mentions that AI-powered automation can shorten development cycles, directly contributing to productivity gains.

**Answer snippet**: According to the corpus, AI code-generation tools significantly enhance developer productivity by automating repetitive tasks, accelerating software development lifecycles, and reducing the need for extensive debugging. Specifically, these tools can lead to shorter development cycles and improved co…

### Failure 2: d03

**Query**: What role does prompt engineering play in AI-augmented software development?

**Groundedness**: 0.1429
**Citation Precision**: 1.0

**Ungrounded sentences**:
> No sufficient evidence found in the corpus.
> Suggested next steps: 
1.

**Answer snippet**: No sufficient evidence found in the corpus.

Suggested next steps: 
1. Query for "Prompt engineering in AI-augmented software development" 
2. Search for "Impact of prompt engineering on code quality and developer productivity in AI-assisted coding"

**Citation Precision**: 0.0

**Ungrounded sentences**:
> **Requirement Analysis**: This phase involves understanding the requirements for the software being developed.
> **Design**: This phase focuses on planning and designing the architecture and structure of the software.

**Answer snippet**: The key phases of the software development lifecycle discussed in the corpus include:

1. **Requirement Analysis**: This phase involves understanding the requirements for the software being developed. [arxiv_2409_18048, arxiv_2409_18048_chunk_0011]
2. **Design**: This phase focuses on planning and d…

### Failure 4: d05

**Query**: How does AI-assisted code review differ from traditional code review?

**Groundedness**: 0.4286
**Citation Precision**: 0.0

**Ungrounded sentences**:
> No sufficient evidence found in the corpus.
> Suggested next steps: 
1.

**Answer snippet**: No sufficient evidence found in the corpus.

Suggested next steps: 
1. Query for studies comparing AI-assisted code review with traditional code review processes in software development.
2. Look for empirical research that examines the specific differences and impacts of AI-assisted versus tradition…

### Failure 5: d06

**Query**: What security concerns are raised about AI-generated code in the literature?

**Groundedness**: 0.5
**Citation Precision**: 0.0

**Ungrounded sentences**:
> Additionally, there is a concern that AI models, which learn from existing codebases, may not recognize app-specific security policies, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
> [Suggested next steps: Examine the security measures implemented by AI-assisted coding tools, explore the current best practices in securing AI-generated code, and review the latest research on AI-generated malware.]

Specifically, AI-assisted coding tools can inadvertently introduce security flaws into so…

## Interpretation

- **Groundedness** measures what fraction of answer sentences are supported by at least one retrieved chunk (word-overlap heuristic, threshold=0.15).
- **Citation Precision** measures what fraction of inline `[source_id, chunk_id]` citations point to chunks that actually support the enclosing sentence.
- Failure cases highlight queries where either metric fell below 0.5, indicating the model may have hallucinated or cited irrelevant chunks.
