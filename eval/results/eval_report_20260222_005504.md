### Failure 5: d06

**Query**: What security concerns are raised about AI-generated code in the literature?

**Groundedness**: 0.25
**Citation Precision**: 0.0

**Ungrounded sentences**:
> Security concerns raised about AI-generated code include the potential for generating insecure or vulnerable code.
> Additionally, AI-generated code may introduce security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, buffer overflows, and data leaks (ijnrd_2024_chunk_0033).

**Answer snippet**: Security concerns raised about AI-generated code include the potential for generating insecure or vulnerable code. For instance, AI models may recommend weak encryption algorithms, suggest insecure code, or fail to recognize app-specific security policies (ijnrd_2024_chunk_0074). Additionally, AI-ge…

## Interpretation

- **Groundedness** measures what fraction of answer sentences are supported by at least one retrieved chunk (word-overlap heuristic, threshold=0.12). The "No sufficient evidence" sentence is treated as correct abstention.
- **Citation Precision** measures what fraction of inline `[source_id, chunk_id]` citations point to chunks that actually support the enclosing sentence (threshold=0.08).
- **Confidence / evidence-strength** is a composite: 0.6×groundedness + 0.4×citation_precision. Tier: high (both ≥0.6), medium (either ≥0.4), low (otherwise). Answers that abstain with "No sufficient evidence" receive 0.5 (correctly abstained).
- Failure cases highlight queries where either groundedness or citation precision fell below 0.5.
