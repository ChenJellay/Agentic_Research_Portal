  "answer": "The most recent papers provide insights into the future of software engineering roles, emphasizing the integration of AI and the shift in the nature of these roles. According to the paper \"AI-Augmented Software Development: Enhancing Code Quality and Developer Productivity\" [ijnrd_2024, section 7], the future of software engineering will be more efficient, innovative, and resilient, driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). This transformation is characterized by the use of computational power to augment human creativity and oversight, leading to more efficient and innovative software development processes.\n\nMoreover, the paper \"Transforming Software Development with Generative AI: Empirical Insights on Collaboration and Workflow\" [arxiv_2405_01543, section 4.6] highlights that GenAI is being used in various tasks, including code refactoring, simplifying code, creating tests, and providing explanations for code. These activities suggest a shift where developers are leveraging AI to enhance their productivity and focus on higher-level tasks that require human creativity and oversight.\n\nIn summary, the most recent papers indicate that AI will play a significant role in augmenting software engineering roles, leading to more efficient workflows and a focus on higher-level problem-solving and innovation rather than repetitive coding tasks.\n\n## References\n- [arxiv_2405_01543, arxiv_2405_01543_chunk_0015]\n- [ijnrd_2024, ijnrd_2024_chunk_0098]",
