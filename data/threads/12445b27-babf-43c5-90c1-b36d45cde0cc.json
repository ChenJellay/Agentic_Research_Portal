      "text": "5. Challenges and limitations of generative AI in software development\nAlthough generative AI brings many benefits to a software development process, including code quality, maintainability,\nand coding speed, the generation of AI code also has unique drawbacks, which must be considered. Some issues faced\ninclude reliance on AI technology, ethical issues and security, technological lapses, and the proliferation of errors. We started today's discussion with an idea of how generative AI can be useful in development of software, and one of\nthe issues we identified includes the problem of overreliance on AI tools in software development. The dilemma would\narise as we see more coding done by AI and real-time code-completion suggestions provided by AI if developers adopt\nthese tools more and more to the extent that their coding skills and problem-solving abilities will begin to degenerate. This dependency can hamper a developer's potential for grasping principles of coding at a fundamental level; they then\nprove to be less apt at determining issues and making constructive architectural decisions. Furthermore, overuse of AI\ncan also lead to the absence of critical thinking among developers since they may unquestioningly believe in AI solutions\nthat they need to scrutinize; they can end up with errors or even second-rate solutions. The use of generative AI, on the other hand, poses serious ethical and security issues that indicate that its\nimplementation in software development is a challenge. Deep learning models are trained in an extensive dataset\ncontaining biased, incorrect, or insecure code snippets, meaning that AI can predetermine such code. For instance, code\ngenerated by artificial intelligence will contain biased algorithms or bring security threats that the programmer cannot\neasily detect. Privacy issues are also involved with using AI, primarily if the AI tool relies on possessing the code for\nsuch vital applications or systems as health care. The significant challenges developers and companies have to solve are\nthe originality of the content, the fairness and security of the code designed by the AI algorithms, and compliance with\nthe non-interference in the rights of individuals and copyright laws. In software development, some technical barriers are associated with generative AI, as follows. The technical barriers\ninvolve: While significant progress has been made in recent years with AI tools to analyze and generate code, the current\nstate of affairs could be better due to many subtle context and requirement-related factors that are always present in\nactual software projects.",
